# InertiaJS configuration

Craftable PRO is using InertiaJS which allow to use `.vue` files for the frontend part of your application instead of Blade templates. You can learn more in [InertiaJS's documentation](https://inertiajs.com/)

## Root template

Craftable PRO is using `resources/views/craftable-pro.blade.php` as a root template for InertiaJS to render the frontend part of your application.

## Middleware

To share data between the backend and the frontend part of your application, we use the `share` function in `Brackets\CraftablePro\Http\Middleware\CraftableProHandleInertiaRequests` middleware. This middleware is already applied to all Craftable PRO routes by default.

If you need to edit shared data inside the middleware, you can do it by publishing the middleware with following command:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=craftable-pro-handle-inertia-requests
```

Afterwards you have to change `handle-inertia-request-class` in `config/craftable.php` to `App\Http\Middleware\CraftableProHandleInertiaRequests`:

```php filename="config/craftable-pro.php" {5}
<?php

return [
    ...
    'handle-inertia-request-class' => App\Http\Middleware\CraftableProHandleInertiaRequests::class,
    ...
];
```

## Using InertiaJS outside Craftable PRO

### Laravel 11+

If you would like to use an InertiaJS in the frontend part of your application we recommend you to separate the Craftable PRO routes with it's own InertiaJS middleware.

<div className="steps-container">

### Extract routes

Move all `craftable-pro` routes from `routes/web.php` into a separate file `routes/craftable-pro.php`

```php filename="routes/craftable-pro.php" copy
<?php

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::craftablePro('admin');
```

### Update `bootstrap/app.php`

Create a new route middleware group, with the same middlewares as you have in the web group:

```php filename="bootstrap/app.php" {5,10-13,18-25}
<?php
use Illuminate\Foundation\Application;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Configuration\Exceptions;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Configuration\Middleware;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

return Application::configure(basePath: dirname(__DIR__))
    ->withRouting(
        web: __DIR__.'/../routes/web.php',
        then: function () {
            Route::middleware('craftable-pro')
                ->group(base_path('routes/craftable-pro.php'));
        },
        commands: __DIR__.'/../routes/console.php',
        health: '/up',
    )
    ->withMiddleware(function (Middleware $middleware) {
        $middleware->appendToGroup('craftable-pro', [
            \Illuminate\Cookie\Middleware\EncryptCookies::class,
            \Illuminate\Cookie\Middleware\AddQueuedCookiesToResponse::class,
            \Illuminate\Session\Middleware\StartSession::class,
            \Illuminate\View\Middleware\ShareErrorsFromSession::class,
            \Illuminate\Foundation\Http\Middleware\ValidateCsrfToken::class,
            \Illuminate\Routing\Middleware\SubstituteBindings::class,
        ]);
    })
    ->withExceptions(function (Exceptions $exceptions) {
        ...
```

</div>

### Older Laravel versions

If you would like to use an InertiaJS in the frontend part of your application we recommend you to separate the Craftable PRO routes with it's own InertiaJS middleware.

<div className="steps-container">

### Extract routes

Move all `craftable-pro` routes from `routes/web.php` into a separate file `routes/craftable-pro.php`

```php filename="routes/craftable-pro.php" copy
<?php

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::craftablePro('admin');
```

### Update `app/Http/Kernel.php`

Create a new route middleware group, with the same middlewares as you have in the web group:

```php filename="Kernel.php" {15-22}
class Kernel extends HttpKernel
{
    ...

    protected $middlewareGroups = [
        'web' => [
            \App\Http\Middleware\EncryptCookies::class,
            \Illuminate\Cookie\Middleware\AddQueuedCookiesToResponse::class,
            \Illuminate\Session\Middleware\StartSession::class,
            \Illuminate\View\Middleware\ShareErrorsFromSession::class,
            \App\Http\Middleware\VerifyCsrfToken::class,
            \Illuminate\Routing\Middleware\SubstituteBindings::class,
        ],

        'craftable-pro' => [
            \App\Http\Middleware\EncryptCookies::class,
            \Illuminate\Cookie\Middleware\AddQueuedCookiesToResponse::class,
            \Illuminate\Session\Middleware\StartSession::class,
            \Illuminate\View\Middleware\ShareErrorsFromSession::class,
            \App\Http\Middleware\VerifyCsrfToken::class,
            \Illuminate\Routing\Middleware\SubstituteBindings::class,
        ],

        'api' => [
            'throttle:api',
            \Illuminate\Routing\Middleware\SubstituteBindings::class,
        ],
    ];
}
```

### Update RouteServiceProvider.php

Register this new middleware group in your RouteServiceProvider. Place it before the `web` group to prevent any wildcard routes from matching before the Craftable PRO routes.

```php filename="RouteServiceProvider.php" {14-15}
class RouteServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    ...

    public function boot()
    {
        $this->configureRateLimiting();

        $this->routes(function () {
            Route::middleware('api')
                ->prefix('api')
                ->group(base_path('routes/api.php'));

            Route::middleware('craftable-pro')
                ->group(base_path('routes/craftable-pro.php'));

            Route::middleware('web')
                ->group(base_path('routes/web.php'));
        });
    }
}
```

</div>
