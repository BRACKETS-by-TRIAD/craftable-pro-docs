# Translation commands

To be able to cover the most of the use cases for translations, Craftable PRO comes with several commands.

## Scan translations

To rescan paths defined in the config and search for new translatable strings (see [Translations Scanners](/basic-features/translations#scanners)), run:

```bash copy
php artisan craftable-pro:scan-translations
```

## Publish translations

To publish translated groups defined in config file (see [Translations Publishing](/basic-features/translations#publishing)), run:

```bash copy
php artisan craftable-pro:publish-translations
```

## Generate permission translations

If you want to have human-readable permission titles in permissions manager (instead of for example `craftable-pro.posts.index`), you can generate permission translations and translate them in Translation manager (see [Translatable permissions](/basic-features/roles-permissions#translatable-permissions)).

```bash copy
php artisan craftable-pro:generate-permission-translations
```

## Generate locale translations

If you want to have human-readable locale titles (instead of for example en_GB), you can generate locale translations and translate them in Translation manager.

```bash copy
php artisan craftable-pro:generate-locale-translations
```
