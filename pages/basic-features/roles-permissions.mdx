# Roles & Permissions

Thanks to Craftable PRO you have been given all you need for setting roles and permissions. We enhanced the popular [Spatie Permissions](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-permission) package adding effective out-of-the-box UI.

## Roles

By default, Craftable PRO comes with tho main roles: Administrator and Guest. You are able to define as many roles as you need.

### Default role after registration

If you have enabled self-registration (see [Users](/basic-features/users#registration)) you can define the default role for newly registered users in Craftable PRO config:

```php filename="config/craftable-pro.php"
 'self_registration' => [
        // define if users can self register into craftable pro interface
        'enabled' => true,

        // and if enabled, then which role(s) they should have assigned by default. Use role names here.
        // It can be a string for one role or an array for multiple roles.
        'default_role' => 'Guest',
    ],
```

## Permissions

After roles are defined you can assign them the permissions by clicking on "Edit permissions" next to the roles in Craftable PRO admin.

In your code permissions can be used for example in `authorize` method in `Request` like this:

```php copy
return Gate::allows('craftable-pro.posts.index');
```

or in directly in `Controllers`:

```php copy
$this->authorize('craftable-pro.posts.index');
```

### Translatable permissions

For a better UI experience you may want to have manageable permissions translations. Craftable PRO has your back, just call

```bash copy
php artisan craftable-pro:generate-permission-translations
```

Now you have all your permission strings available in the Translations manager (see [Translations](/basic-features/translations)).
