# Installation

Craftable PRO is a package for Laravel that can be installed on any existing Laravel 10+ project. If you're starting a new project, install Laravel first - please follow steps in the official [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/installation).

<div className="steps-container">

### Buy license

You can buy a license on our [Craftable PRO website](https://craftable.pro#pricing). Afterwards, you will receive an email with a license key which you will need to continue with the installation.

### Register the repository

After obtaining a valid [Craftable PRO license](https://craftable.pro#pricing) you need to add our private repository to your composer.json:

```bash copy
composer config repositories.craftable-pro composer https://packages.craftable.pro/
```

### Add the package

Require the package with composer. You will be asked for username and password during the installation. **Use your email address as the username and the license key, you received after purchasing the license, as the password.** Alternatively you can create local or global `auth.json` file with your credentials. You can find more information about this in the [Composer documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/authentication-for-private-packages.md#authentication-in-auth-json-per-project).

```bash copy
composer require brackets/craftable-pro
```

### Install the package

This command will publish resources, migrations, configs, edit some configuration files and more. <br/>
Check out [Install command](/v3/commands/installation-command) section for more information.

```bash copy
php artisan craftable-pro:install
```

### Build frontend assets

You can use whatever package manager you preffer, but we will use `npm` in this example.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn"]}>
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
npm install
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
yarn install
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Afterwards you can start Vite with:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn"]}>
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
npm run craftable-pro:dev
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
yarn craftable-pro:dev
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Or you can build the assets for production with:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn"]}>
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
npm run craftable-pro:build
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
yarn craftable-pro:build
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout>
  Note that if you use InertiaJS in your project, we recommend you to [merge Vite
  configs](/v3/getting-started/vite-configuration#combining-vite-configs). We also recommend
  to [separate Craftable PRO
  routes](/v3/getting-started/inertiajs-configuration#using-inertiajs-outside-craftable-pro)
  from your application routes to isolate InertiaJS middlewares.
</Callout>

### Test your installation

After running Vite, you should be able to visit Craftable PRO at `http://localhost/admin`.

Login with the credentials provided during installation.

</div>

### What happens when your license expires

A few days before your license expires, we will send you a reminder email to renew it.

If you decide not to renew your license, you will no longer be able to use Composer to install this package, nor will you receive any new features or bug fixes.

Instead, you may host the last version you downloaded in your own private repository.
