<div className="steps-container">

### Update composer.json
Increase version number of `"brackets/craftable-pro"` in `composer.json` to ^3.0 and run:

```bash copy
composer update brackets/craftable-pro -W
```

### Publish Migrations, Assets, and JS Stubs
Execute the following commands in your terminal to publish migrations, public assets, and JavaScript stubs required for Craftable PRO:
```bash copy
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Brackets\CraftablePro\CraftableProServiceProvider" --tag="craftable-pro-migrations"
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Brackets\CraftablePro\CraftableProServiceProvider" --tag="craftable-pro-public"
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Brackets\CraftablePro\CraftableProServiceProvider" --tag="craftable-pro-js-stubs"
```

Don't forget to run the migrations after publishing them:
```bash copy
php artisan migrate
```

### Update Configuration

If you've previously published the Craftable PRO configuration file, please ensure it's updated.
In v3, we changed config for `translations`.

Compare your values in your project's `config/craftable-pro.php` with the default configuration found at `vendor/brackets/craftable-pro/config/craftable-pro.php`.

### Update ziggy import

Replace ziggy import inside your `resources/js/craftable-pro/index.ts` to:

```js copy
import { ZiggyVue } from "ziggy/src/js";
```

If error about missing Tightenco\Ziggypops up, clear the views cache, or remove @routes in `resources/views/craftable-pro.blade.php` and put back. Namespace was changed from Tightenco\Ziggy to Tighten\Ziggy.

### Load built-in pages from vendor

In v2, the built-in pages like Media or Users were published to your project.
As part of v3, we created a system for loading pages from vendor, so it is no longer required for them to be published.

You can safely delete the built-in pages from `resources/js/craftable-pro/Pages` unless you have edited any of them.
The built-in pages are:

```
    └── resources/
        └── js/
            └── craftable-pro/
                └── Pages/
                    ├── Auth/
                    ├── CraftableProUser/
                    ├── Media/
                    ├── Permissions/
                    ├── Roles/
                    ├── Settings/
                    ├── Translations/
                    └── Home.vue
```


To correctly load pages from vendor, replace `resolve` part in your `resources/js/craftable-pro/index.ts` to following:

```js copy
resolve: async (name: string) => {
    // Getting all the pages from the craftable-pro package
    const craftableProPagesGlob = import.meta.glob(
        "../../../vendor/brackets/**/resources/js/Pages/**/*.vue",
    );

    // Getting all local pages
    const pagesLocalGlob = import.meta.glob("./Pages/**/*.vue");

    // Resolving all the pages from the craftable-pro package and the local package
    const [pagesCraftablePro, pagesLocal] = await Promise.all([
        craftableProPagesGlob,
        pagesLocalGlob,
    ]);

    // Merging all the pages from the craftable-pro package and the local package with the local ones taking precedence
    const pages = { ...pagesLocal, ...pagesCraftablePro };

    // Finding the page that matches the name
    const pagePath = Object.keys(pages).find((key) =>
        key.endsWith(`/${name}.vue`),
    );

    // Throwing an error if the page is not found
    if (!pagePath) {
        throw new Error(`Page '${name}' not found.`);
    }

    // Getting the page component
    const pageComponent = (await pages[pagePath]()).default;

    const page = pageComponent;

    // Setting the layout if it's not set
    if (page.layout === undefined) {
        if (name.startsWith("Auth/")) {
            page.layout = GuestLayout;
        } else {
            page.layout = AuthenticatedLayout;
        }
    }

    return page;
},
```

### Upgrade Tailwind config

To craftable-pro.tailwind.config.js add darkMode: 'class'.

```bash copy
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./resources/views/craftable-pro.blade.php",
    "./resources/js/craftable-pro/**/*.vue",
    "./vendor/brackets/craftable-pro/resources/js/**/*.vue"
  ],
  darkMode: 'class',
  theme: {
  ...
```

### Upgrade npm dependencies

To update to Inertia.js v2, you need to upgrade the npm package by running:

```bash copy
npm install @inertiajs/vue3@2
```

### Update overloaded theme files

In case you overloaded any of the theme files, you need to check the changes in the original files and apply them to your own files.

### Run npm install and npm run craftable-pro:dev

Finally, don't forget to run `craftable-pro:build` or `craftable-pro:dev` to ensure that your project's frontend assets are up-to-date.
