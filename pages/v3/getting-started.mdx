## Browser Support

Our framework is designed to provide compatibility with the following web browsers:

- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Apple Safari
- Microsoft Edge
- Opera

For the best experience and optimal performance, we recommend using the latest versions of these browsers when working with our framework. While efforts are made to maintain compatibility across these browsers, some features may vary or have limited support in older browser versions.


## Security

If you discover any security vulnerabilities or issues, please **DO NOT** report them on GitHub issues or forums to prevent potential exploitation. Instead, we highly encourage responsible disclosure through private communication channels.

To report a security concern, please reach out to our security team via email at [support@craftable.pro](mailto:support@craftable.pro). We appreciate your cooperation in helping to keep our framework secure for everyone.

## Maintenance

We are committed to the continuous improvement and development of our framework. Our team is actively working on enhancing its features, addressing issues, and incorporating user feedback into future updates.

New versions and updates will be released periodically to ensure compatibility, stability, and security. We encourage users to stay updated with the latest releases to benefit from new features, performance improvements, and bug fixes.

## License

Our framework is available under a commercial license. The paid version provides full access to all features, and commercial use rights.
If you are interested in an open-source version, please take a look at our free [Craftable](https://getcraftable.com/) built on Vue2 (for this reason it is incompatible with Craftable Pro).
