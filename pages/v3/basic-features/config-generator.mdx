# Config Generator

Craftable PRO provides a powerful YAML-based configuration system that allows you to quickly generate whole CRUD including multiple models, routes, controllers, views etc. from single YAML file.

<Callout>
YAML config files are also generated when using [CRUD generator command](/v3/commands/crud-generator-command)
</Callout>

## Configuration Structure

The configuration file is built around models. You can define multiple models in one file. 
For each model you can define the following:

### table

The name of the table in the database. For example `posts`.

### skip_model

If set to `true`, the model class will not be generated or overwritten if exists.

### columns

Database columns definition. This use common syntax with Laravel Blueprint. Please refer to official [Blueprint docs](https://blueprint.laravelshift.com/docs/defining-models/) to see all definitions.

### listing

List of columns that should be displayed in the listing table. The order will be preserved and used in the table.

You can add `sortable` to allow sorting by the column.

You can add `searchable` to allow search by the column.

### form

List of fields that will be used for edit/create form. Fields need to be defined inside `cards` and `columns`.
This is because the form can have multi column layout, where every column can have multiple cards (visual group of fields).

Refer to the example YAML config file bellow to see the exact structure.

### translatable

List of fields, that should be translatable. For these fields, you will be able to use translations by Spatie's [Laravel Translatable package](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-translatable/introduction).

### publishable

Name of the field, that will be used for publishing functionality. Special form field and listing column will be generated for publishable field.

### media_collections

List of media collections, using Spatie's [Laravel Medialibrary](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-medialibrary/introduction).

You can add `isImage` to collection to define image collection.

### relationships

List of relationships you want to define on the model. You can define `belongsTo` or `belongsToMany` relationships.

### api

List of API endpoints. You can generate following endpoints:
- index
- store
- update
- show
- destroy

Every endpoint except `destroy` requires you to define `columns`, which is list of 
fields that will be returned from the enpoint (for GET requests) or be accepted by the endpoint
(for POST/PUT requests).

If you want to skip generation of specific endpoint, simply exclude it from the config file.

### features

List of additional features that will be generated. Right now, we support following features:
- `export`: will generate excel export

            features:

## Using pre-made YAML configs

Since you can define the whole CRUD in one YAML file, it is really easy to share the config files between the projects.
We are right now preparing a set of shareable YAML files that you can use to generate the whole app like CRM or Blog.
These YAML configs will be published soon on [craftable.pro](https://craftable.pro).
