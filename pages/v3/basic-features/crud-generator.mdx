# CRUD Generator

CRUD Generator allows you to easily generate CRUD for existing table, all with a single command. It will generate all the files needed for the CRUD to work, including listing page, form page, model, controller, request classes, routes, Vue files and Typescript definitions.

You can explore all the available options in the detailed [command documentation](/v3/commands/crud-generator-command).

    Crud generator works by generating YAML config files, which are then used to generate the actual code. For more information, see [YAML config generator](/v3/basic-features/config-generator)
