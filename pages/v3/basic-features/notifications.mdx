# Notifications

Craftable PRO integrates with Laravel's database notifications system to provide a notification center within your admin panel. For basic notification usage, please refer to [Laravel's official notification documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/notifications).

## Notification Center

Craftable PRO provides a built-in notification dropdown in the admin panel header, allowing users to:

- View unread notifications
- Mark individual notifications as read
- Mark all notifications as read
- Navigate to related content through action URLs

## Sending notifications
Basics of sending notifications can be found in official Laravel documentation: [Sending Notifications](https://laravel.com/docs/notifications#sending-notifications)
The notification should include:
- title: text representing title of the notification
- body: text representing body of the notification
- icon: url of the image or null to use fallback icon
- action: url that will be opened when notification is clicked or null to not open any url

See the following example of toArray method in notification class:

```php
public function toArray(object $notifiable): array
{
    return [
        'title' => 'Verification required',
        'body' => 'Please verify your account by clicking on this notification',
        'icon' => null,
        'action' => 'https://demoapp.test/verify',
    ];
}
```
