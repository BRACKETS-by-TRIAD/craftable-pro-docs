# Using InertiaJs on frontend

If you would like to use an InertiaJS on your FE we recommend you to separate the Craftable PRO routes
with it's own InertiaJS middleware.

### If you using InertiaJs on frontend need to do:

<div className="steps-container">
    ### Extract routes
    Extract all routes definition `craftable-pro` into a separate file `routes/craftable-pro.php`

    Example:
    `Route::craftablePro('admin');`

    ### Update Kernel.php
    Create a new route middleware group, with the same middlewares as you have in the web group:

    ```bash copy
    'craftable-pro' => [
        \App\Http\Middleware\EncryptCookies::class,
        \Illuminate\Cookie\Middleware\AddQueuedCookiesToResponse::class,
        \Illuminate\Session\Middleware\StartSession::class,
        \Illuminate\View\Middleware\ShareErrorsFromSession::class,
        \App\Http\Middleware\VerifyCsrfToken::class,
        \Illuminate\Routing\Middleware\SubstituteBindings::class,
    ]
    ```

    ### Update RouteServiceProvider.php
    Register this new middleware group in your RouteServiceProvider

    ```bash copy
    Route::middleware('craftable-pro')
        ->group(base_path('routes/craftable-pro.php'));
    ```
</div>
