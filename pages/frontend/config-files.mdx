# Config files

Installing Craftable PRO will copy to your project some config files.
-   `craftable-pro.vite.config.js` - Vite config file
-   `craftable-pro.tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind config file wich you can customize to suit your needs


### Vite aliases

Craftable PRO needs three Vite aliases to work properly. These aliases are defined in the `craftable-pro.vite.config.js` file. Bellow is their explanation for better orientation:

-   `@` - pointing to resources folder in your project, where are located some of the components for better customizability. This alias is used by some of the Craftable PRO components, so please don't change it since it might break your layout.
-   `craftable-pro` - used to load all Craftable PRO components
-   `ziggy` - used to load helper functions from Ziggy to used named routes in your project

### Tailwind config file

Craftable PRO uses Tailwind CSS for styling. You can customize the config file to suit your needs. For more information about Tailwind CSS visit their [documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration).
