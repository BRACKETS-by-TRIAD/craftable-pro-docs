# Components

All of Craftable PRO Vue components are located in the vendor folder. This way we can ensure their updateability. Bellow is the file structure for better orientation:

```
vendor/brackets/craftable-pro/resources/js
├── Components/
├── helpers/
├── hooks/
├── Layouts/
├── Pages/
├── plugins/
└── types/
```

To import Craftable PRO components you can use the `craftable-pro` alias. For example:

```js
import { Button } from "craftable-pro/Components";
```
