- If you have any Craftable PRO requests already generated, check if their namespace is correct. Each request should have following namespace `App\Http\Requests\CraftablePro\<ModelName>`.

Don't forget to change the namespace in the controllers as well.

  - find all instances of `route` function with built-in Craftable PRO routes in your Sidebar.vue file. See the list bellow for all Craftable PRO routes and change them to include `craftable-pro.` prefix (note that `*` is a wildcard for all nested routes):
