<div className="steps-container">

### Register private repository

After obtaining a valid Craftable PRO license you need to add our private repository to Composer in your Laravel project:

```bash copy
composer config repositories.craftable-pro vcs git@github.com:BRACKETS-by-TRIAD/craftable-pro.git
```

### Require composer package

```bash copy
composer require brackets/craftable-pro
```

### Run installation command

This command will publish resources, migrations, configs, edit some configuration files and more. <br/>
Check out [Install command](/commands/installation-command) section for more information.

```bash copy
php artisan craftable-pro:install
```

### Build frontend assets

You can use whatever package manager you preffer, but we will use `npm` in this example.

```bash copy
npm install
```

Afterwards you can start Vite with:

```bash copy
npm run craftable-pro:dev
```

Or you can build the assets for production with:

```bash copy
npm run craftable-pro:build
```

### Test your installation

After running Vite, you should be able to visit Craftable PRO at `http://localhost:8000/admin`. Login with the credentials provided during installation.
