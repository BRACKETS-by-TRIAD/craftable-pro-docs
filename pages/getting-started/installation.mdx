# Installation

<div className="steps-container">

### Register private repository

After obtaining a valid Craftable PRO license you need to add our private repository to your project:

```bash copy
composer config repositories.craftable-pro vcs git@github.com:BRACKETS-by-TRIAD/craftable-pro.git
```

### Require composer package

```bash copy
composer require brackets/craftable-pro
```

### Run installation command

This command will publish resources, migrations, configs, edit some configuration files and more. <br/>
Check on [Install command](/commands/installation-command) from more informations.

```bash copy
php artisan craftable-pro:install
```

### Build frontend assets

You can use whatever package manager you preffer, but we will use `npm` in this example.

```bash copy
npm install
```

Afterwards you can start Vite with:

```bash copy
npm run craftable-pro:dev
```

Or you can build the assets for production with:

```bash copy
npm run craftable-pro:build
```

### If you using InertiaJs on frontend need to do:

Extract all routes definition `craftable-pro` into a separate file `routes/craftable-pro.php`

Add into Kernel.php this lines:

```bash copy
'craftable-pro' => [
    \App\Http\Middleware\EncryptCookies::class,
    \Illuminate\Cookie\Middleware\AddQueuedCookiesToResponse::class,
    \Illuminate\Session\Middleware\StartSession::class,
    \Illuminate\View\Middleware\ShareErrorsFromSession::class,
    \App\Http\Middleware\VerifyCsrfToken::class,
    \Illuminate\Routing\Middleware\SubstituteBindings::class,
]
```

Add into RouteServiceProvider.php this lines:

```bash copy
Route::middleware('craftable-pro')
    ->group(base_path('routes/craftable-pro.php'));
```
